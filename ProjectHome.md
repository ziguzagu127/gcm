Google Cloud Messaging for Android (GCM) is a service that helps developers send data from servers to their Android applications on Android devices. The service provides a simple, lightweight mechanism that servers can use to tell mobile applications to contact the server directly, to fetch updated application or user data. The GCM service handles all aspects of queueing of messages and delivery to the target Android application running on the target device.
